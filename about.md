Howdy! My name is Axel Kee. I am the founder, software developer, copywriter and goat-keeper for Yagi Software.

I have worked with multiple Shopify (and Shopify Plus) stores on store customization and private apps development, with very happy store owners ðŸ˜„.

I wish to share my experience on Shopify store customizing in this blog, and hope it can help increase conversion and customer happiness on your Shopify store.

You can contact me via email: axel@yagisoftware.com.

If you would like to reduce support time spent on customer order cancellation and refund, my app [Cancellable](https://apps.shopify.com/cancellable) can help!

The app was featured by Shopify from 23 May to 22 June 2021!
