The draft order feature on Shopify is great for taking order on phone, or at event booth. You can add discount individually to each item, but there's no discount code field on the checkout link generated from draft order?!

Discount code is useful that we can set the rules on what products (product types, collection, tags) are eligible for discount, and we can set different discount amount depending on the cart items.

Without discount code, the staff taking order over the phone would need to memorize what items are in a collection, which are eligible for discount, and had to calculate manually using a calculator (alongside the computer)! Needless to say, this process can be error prone and the staff would have to have in-depth knowledge of products/collection and good math skills.

Fortunately, there's a workaround for this!

## Add discount code to draft order using Draft Order Helper app

Using [Draft Order Helper app](https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper), you can add the discount code field to checkout page created from draft order. (Disclaimer: I am the developer of this app, the app has a free plan which you can try it out)

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.yagisoftware.com/Shopify-App-Store-Badge-Final-Black.png" style="max-width: 250px; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: none; border-width: 0;"></a>
</div>

After installing the app, you can go to your draft order, click "More actions" > "**Generate discountable checkout link**".

You can then input the discount code, or leave it blank for the customer to input it later.

Then click the "Create checkout from draft" button to generate a checkout that has the discount code applied (or has discount code field for the customer to input).

You will then retrieve a checkout link, which you can send to your customer for them to input discount code and checkout!

I understand it might be hard to trust a random app you came across on internet, you can refer to [these reviews on the app from happy store owners](https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper/reviews), most of them has used the app for many months and are very happy with it.

I am actively supporting the app as well, if you have any question on installing or using the app, you can always email me and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
