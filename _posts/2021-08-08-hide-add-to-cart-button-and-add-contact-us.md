There might be some products which you don't want customers to be able to purchase online due to licensing issues, or the product is only available to purchase in-person in store due to regulation etc.

This tutorial will guide you on how to hide the add to cart / buy now button, and optionally replace it with a "contact us" link. This tutorial will require you to edit code of your theme, knowledge of HTML / CSS / Liquid would help but it is not required.
