Sometimes you might have a special product or service which you don't want a customer to be able to search from your store search or Google search, as you want to only let certain customers to access it via direct link from email or from an Adwords campaign.



Changing the product status to draft does hide it from search, but it would make it unavailable to those who have a direct link as well, hence this method does not work.



There's ways to hide product in search using product tags and editing code on the collection or search page template, but if you are not familiar with coding, it can be risky to do so as it might cause customer to unable to browse the product collections if you happen to accidentally mess up the collection page.



Fortunately, you can hide product from search without needing to edit the code on your collection or search page.


You can utilize the "metafields" function from Shopify to hide the product from search. If you haven't heard of the term "metafields" before, metafields are extra pieces of data that you can attach to products, customers, orders, and other objects in your Shopify store.



Currently Shopify doesn't have an official way to edit metafields for products, you would have to download third party apps to be able to edit metafields. I recommend using [Metafields Custom Field Master](https://apps.shopify.com/metafields-manager-by-hulkapps?) app to edit metafields, as they have a generous free plan that lets you add metafields to unlimited products, I will be using this app for the following steps.







To-do:

Create a default collection titled "All" , set automatic, products price > 0 and not tagged "hidden"
