Shopify has rolled out one page checkout to all stores earlier this year (2023), but some merchants has seen significant drop on their conversion rate after the one page checkout was rolled out, and it wasn't reversible for non Shopify Plus merchant, for a long while.

At 17 November 2023, [Shopify announced](https://community.shopify.com/c/shopify-design/updated-all-merchants-now-have-the-option-to-choose-one-page-or/m-p/2307626#M609257) that all merchants (including non Plus) can now revert to three page checkout (multi page checkout)!

If your store's conversion rate has been affected by the one page checkout, you can revert back to the three page checkout using the following steps.


Go to your Shopify Admin > Themes, and click "Customize" on your current theme :

In the theme editor, navigate to the "Checkout" page :

Open the Theme settings :

Scroll to the "Checkout" section on the left section, and expand it :

After saving the changes, your store will use the three page layout for checkout.
