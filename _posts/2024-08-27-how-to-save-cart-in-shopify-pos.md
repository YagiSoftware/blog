With the recent update of Shopify POS, Shopify has removed the "Save Cart" and "View Carts" tile, and encouraged merchant to use the "Save as draft order" instead.

"Save as draft order" does work to an extent, but when you view draft orders in the POS, draft orders from the Shopify Admin (Online store) will be visible as well, which causes confusion. Saving as draft orders will also clutter the Shopify Admin's draft orders list with temporary carts of in-store customers!

It also takes a lot more taps to save and view draft orders, as it is not accessible via the tile at the home screen of POS, which can be very inconvenient when the store is having high traffic of customers.

What if you could get back the original "Save cart" feature? Now your retail staff can save customers in-progress shopping in store, whenever there is any interruption by another customers, and return to the saved cart after the ad-hoc task is finished. You could save time and serve more customers (and more happy customers).
