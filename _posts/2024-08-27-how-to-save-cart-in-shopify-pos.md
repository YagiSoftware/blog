With the recent update of Shopify POS, Shopify has removed the "Save Cart" and "View Carts" tile, and encouraged merchant to use the "Save as draft order" instead.

"Save as draft order" does work to an extent, but when you view draft orders in the POS, draft orders from the Shopify Admin (Online store) will be visible as well, which causes confusion. Saving as draft orders will also clutter the Shopify Admin's draft orders list with temporary carts of in-store customers!

It also takes a lot more taps to save and view draft orders, as it is not accessible via the tile at the home screen of POS, which can be very inconvenient when the store is having high traffic of customers.

What if you could get back the original "Save cart" feature? Now your retail staff can save customers in-progress shopping in store, whenever there is any interruption by another customers, and return to the saved cart after the ad-hoc task is finished. You could save time and serve more customers (and more happy customers).

With <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/yagi-pos-cart-helper?utm_source=yagi" target="_blank">Yagi POS Cart Helper app</a>, you can save the current cart progress, and retrieve the cart later easily to continue serve the customer. (Disclaimer: I am the developer of this app)

## Create POS Cart from Draft Order

If your store accept booking online and customers want to pay on-site (could be walk in appointment, on-site service or pickup), you can create a POS Cart from draft order, and access this cart on your POS, and accept payment using POS , which can be tipped as well!

You can go to your draft order in Shopify Admin, click "More actions" > "Create POS Cart" :

After creating the POS Cart, you can now access this cart (filled with the items and details from the draft order) on your POS device!
