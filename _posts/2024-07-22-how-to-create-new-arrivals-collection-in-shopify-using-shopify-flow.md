This tutorial requires using Shopify Flow app on your store, you can install the [free Shopify Flow app (by Shopify) here](https://apps.shopify.com/flow) if you haven't already.

Shopify's collection is useful to group products together, and we can use automated collection with tags, to group products that have the specified tag into one collection. 

With the tag, we can easily group new arrival products into collection by assigning a tag to them when creating product, but who has the time to remove the tag for those products one by one afterwards? Heck, sometimes we might even forgot to apply tag when creating product.

Fortunately, Shopify Flow app can help us automate the process of adding and removing tag for products!
