Customers can make mistakes when ordering. They might enter the wrong shipping address, want to change order items, or simply just changed their mind, and then they will contact your customer support to request cancellation and each support might take quite some time to respond back and take at least 10 minutes back and forth to cancel, which could be spent on supporting another customer and earn more revenue!

What if the customer can cancel order on their own, without having to take away precious customer support time? Customer also get instant order cancellation / refund, which increase customer satisfaction and make them more likely to come back to your store, and might recommend to others as they feel your store is trustworthy. Wouldn't that be good? 

Unfortunately Shopify by default does not provide the cancellation function on customer side, you would have to custom code it on your store, hire an expert to do it for you, or install a Shopify app for it.

With <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/cancellable?utm_source=yagi" target="_blank">Cancellable app</a>, you can let customers cancel order, edit order or reorder easily. (Disclaimer: I am the developer of this app)

<div class="video-container">

</div>

The app provides interface for customers to cancel/edit/reorder on the order status page (thank you page), and also on the customer account page that shows order histories. 

It also increase sales by allowing customer to reorder by just clicking the Reorder button.

# Limit time frame for order cancellation

It would be bad if a customer manages to cancel an order after the order is being sent to production, you can set a time limit for order cancellation in the app to prevent this, eg: customer can only cancel their order within 1 hour of placing it.

<br><br>
# Only allow an order to be cancelled before daily fulfillment time

Your store might have a daily fulfillment cut off time, which you fulfill the orders that are placed before that time.

You can also set these time in the Cancellable app, so that a customer cannot cancel an order after the fulfillment time has passed for that day.

# Manually disable order cancellation if the order contains certain product

For certain products that are specifically tailored for a customer, or have high production cost, you might want to disallow cancellation on that order if the order contain such products.

You can tag a product with **"cannot-cancel"** , then an order placed with such product will not be able to cancelled by the customer. You can also tag an order with **"cannot-cancel"** to disable cancellation.

# Understand why customer cancels an order

You can enable **cancellation reason** in the app, and customer will be prompted to select a reason on why they are cancelling an order. Then you can gain insight on this, eg: many customer cancel an order after realizing their shipping info is incorrect, then you can add a FAQ about shipping options on your store to help clarify.
