Before you make any code changes on your theme, it would be good if you make a copy / duplicate of your current theme. In case anything goes wrong with the changes, you can easily revert back to the copied theme and publish it. (So it won't affect customers experience)

To make a duplicate, go to your Shopify Admin > Themes, click the three dots beside your theme, and click "Duplicate" : 
![Duplicate your current theme](https://img.yagisoftware.com/21-backup-theme/duplicate.png)

Shopify will then generate a copy of your theme, and you can publish this theme later on, in case there is any mistake on your current theme.
