By default, Shopify will place a "Shipping calculated at Checkout" text on the cart and product page, which is not really informative to the customer, customers want to know what day will the product ships, or if there is any free shipping provided. (Providing free shipping is a good way to increase conversion rate!).

Fortunately, we can change this text in the store theme without having to modify any code.
