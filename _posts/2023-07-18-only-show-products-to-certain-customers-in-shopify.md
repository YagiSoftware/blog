It could be some early drop of products which you only want VIP customer to be able to purchase first, or wholesale products with heavily discounted price which you only want registered wholesale customer to be able to purchase it.

There's apps that offer features that lock a product and make it available only for selected customers, they offer complex rules management, but if you just want to show product to customers that are tagged with certain tag, it might be overkill to use an app for it.

This tutorial will guide you on how to modify your theme to create a new product template , which the private product can use, and the product will only show to the tagged customers. This tutorial will require some copy pasting of code, the tutorial will guide on where and how to copy paste, and you will not need to have any coding experience to follow. As the tutorial only creates new product template and does not modify existing ones, you don't have to worry that you might mess up existing code.

## Make a page that show text that say "Product available for special member only"

## Create new product template


## Create new product section json, edit the <section> part
