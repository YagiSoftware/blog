When a customer comes into your store with a gift card and wants to check the gift card balance, how should you proceed?

The [official Shopify instruction](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-in-person/shopify-pos/customer-management/customer-giftcards) mentioned to go to the customers page, find the customer name who have purchased the gift card, and tap the "View all gift cards". 

The instruction assumes that the customer who walked in with gift card is the same person who purchased the gift card, which is very unlikely, why would a customer purchase a gift card and use it themselves?! (Gift card is meant to be gifted to others) The person receiving the gift card might not know the name of the purchaser, which makes it impossible to search the customer and thus the gift card info.

Fortunately, Shopify POS has a global search icon, which you can tap and scan the QR code of the gift card (if the customer has it).

After scanning the QR code, the gift card balance, expiry date and original purchaser name information will be shown on screen.

## Checking gift card balance when there is no QR code available

What if the customer does not have the QR code of the gift card? They might only have the gift card code number (eg: ABCD DEFG) on hand.

Unfortunately Shopify POS requires QR code to check the gift card balance, but with <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/yagi-pos-cart-helper?utm_source=yagi" target="_blank">Yagi POS Cart Helper app</a>, you can easily check the gift card balance and information using the last 4 digits of the gift card code.  (Disclaimer: I am the developer of this app)

After installing the app, you can add the "Check Gift Card Balance" tile onto your Shopify POS main screen, and you can then tap this tile to check the gift card balance :
