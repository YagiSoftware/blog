Currently Shopify does not have a function to change a items price in a draft order. Although there is a discount function which you can apply discount to reduce an item price, there is no way to increase an item price in a draft order, which can be frustrating as sometimes some corporate customers require higher pricing.


There's a workaround which you can add an additional custom item, for example your original product price is $5, and you want to sell it for $6 in your draft order, then you can add a custom item and price it at $1, to make the invoice total to be $6. This workaround does make the invoice total to be correct, but the sales amount reported in your product sales report will be inaccurate, as the report will show that the product is being sell for $5, not $6.


Wouldn't it be nice if there is a "Edit Price" field for the item, instead of just discount? With the help of <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper" target="_blank">Draft Order Helper app</a>, you can set a higher price (or a lower price) for items in draft order!

## Set higher item price (or lower) using Draft Order Helper app

Using [Draft Order Helper app](https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper), you can set a higher price (or lower) for items in a draft order easily. (Disclaimer: I am the developer of this app, the app has a free plan which you can try it out)

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.yagisoftware.com/Shopify-App-Store-Badge-Final-Black.png" style="max-width: 250px; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: none; border-width: 0;"></a>
</div>

After installing the app, you can go to your draft order, click "More actions" > "**Increase item prices**".

![Select Increase item prices](https://yagisoftware.s3.amazonaws.com/23-how-to-set-higher-price-for-draft-order-items-on-shopify/markup.png)

Then you can select the items which you want to change the price (click the checkbox on the left of the items), and input the new price you want for the item, and click "Apply" to apply the changes.

After clicking "Apply new item price to current draft", you will see the new prices reflected in the draft order :

And the price of the products in the store remains the same.


## Save time and effort by changing item prices directly in draft order

With [Draft Order Helper app](https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper), you can change items price in a draft order easily, without having to calculate price difference and create custom item manually, and you dont have to sacrifice sales report accuracy this way.

[Draft Order Helper app](https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper) comes with a free plan, give it a try you if you would like to solve the issue of overselling and save time on manual inventory adjustment workaround.

I understand it might be hard to trust a random app you came across on internet, you can refer to [these reviews on the app from happy store owners](https://apps.shopify.com/draft-helper/reviews), most of them has used the app for many months and are very happy with it.

I am actively supporting the app as well, if you have any question on installing or using the app, you can always email me and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Cheers,
