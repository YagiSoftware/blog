Customers might have moved to a new address due to life circumstances before your products are shipped out, or they could have just entered the wrong address mistakenly, or simply selected the wrong auto fill, and they will contact your customer support to request shipping address amendment and each support might take quite some time to respond back and take at least 10 minutes back and forth to edit, which could be spent on supporting another customer and earn more revenue! Or worse, the customer didn't contact support in time, and the package has been already shipped to the old address!

What if the customer can update the shipping address on their own, without having to take away precious customer support time? Customer also get instant update, which increase customer satisfaction, and you could save on potential shipping fee wastage!

Unfortunately Shopify by default does not provide the update shipping address function on customer side, you would have to custom code it on your store, hire an expert to do it for you, or install a Shopify app for it.
